# OpenUnReID

## Introduction
`OpenUnReID` is an open-source PyTorch-based codebase for both unsupervised learning (**USL**) and unsupervised domain adaptation (**UDA**) in the context of object re-ID tasks. It provides strong baselines and multiple state-of-the-art methods with highly refactored codes for both *pseudo-label-based* and *domain-translation-based* frameworks. It works with **Python >=3.5** and **PyTorch >=1.1**.

We are actively updating this repo, and more methods will be supported soon. Contributions are welcome.

### Major features
- [x] Distributed training & testing with multiple GPUs and multiple machines.
- [x] High flexibility on various combinations of datasets, backbones, losses, etc.
- [x] GPU-based pseudo-label generation and k-reciprocal re-ranking with quite high speed.
- [x] Plug-and-play domain-specific BatchNorms for any backbones, sync BN is also supported.
- [x] State-of-the-art methods and performances for both USL and UDA problems on object re-ID.
<!-- - [x] A strong clustering baseline (refined `UDA_TP`), providing high extensibility on designing new methods. -->

## Acknowledgement

Some parts of `openunreid` are learned from [torchreid](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/deep-person-reid) and [fastreid](https://github.com/JDAI-CV/fast-reid). We would like to thank for their projects, which have boosted the research of supervised re-ID a lot. We hope that `OpenUnReID` could well benefit the research community of unsupervised re-ID by providing strong baselines and state-of-the-art methods.
